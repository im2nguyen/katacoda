In this scenario, you use a Terraform provider to interact with a fictional coffee-shop application, HashiCups. In the process, you will learn how providers map target APIs to Terraform in order to create, read, update and delete resources.

This scenario is meant to serve as a companion lab for the [Perform CRUD operations with Providers Learn guide](https://deploy-preview-1641--hashicorp-learn.netlify.app/tutorials/terraform/provider-use?in=terraform/providers).
