## Overview of Workspace

This is the workspace for the [**Register External Services with Terraform**](http://learn.hashicorp.com/consul/developer-discovery/terraform-consul-provider) guide.

These services can be open by clicking on their respective tabs in the terminal.

On initialization, this workspace should have ran `docker-compose up -d` which spins
up the above services in the background. To view these instances, run `docker ps`{{execute}}

It takes about a minute after you see the `Ready` message for the Consul datacenter
to nominate a cluster leader and for you to continue to the next step.

## Bootstrap Consul datacenter

`docker exec -it consul-playground_consul-server-1_1 consul acl bootstrap`{{execute}}

For more information about this command, please reference the guide.

## Localhost Substitution

NOTE: If you are using Katacoda, Katacoda uses a unique method to route its services.

As a result, you should substitute any references to localhost to the following:

| Learn Address   | Katacoda Address |
| --------------  | ---------------- |
| localhost:8500  | `[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8500-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com` |
| localhost:9001  | `[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-9001-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com` |
| localhost:8080  | `[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8080-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com` |

Remember to substitute `ACL_TOKEN_HERE` with your master ACL token. Your `~/getting-started-terraform-consul-provider/main.tf`{{open}} file should be similar to:

<pre class="file" data-filename="~/getting-started-terraform-consul-provider/main.tf" data-target="replace">
